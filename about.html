                <h3>Software Engineer</h3>
                <p>At TDT, I created high level components for a Windows application called "Synapse". These components allowed neuroscientists to better design experiments and collect data. I spent most of my time coding in C++ using the Qt framework, but occasionally I would complete a wide range of in-house programming tasks by coding in Python and JavaScript. Sometimes, I would even cross-compile code to be tested in embedded linux devices.</p>

                <p>During my last years at University of Florida, I joined a start-up venture with my friends called Dycap, an audio-visual equipment company that sold a revolutionary product called "PerfectTrack". This software enabled the hands-free tracking of subjects for use with remote controlled cameras. I was responsible for the user experience and system design, leveraging my knowledge in Linux, Python, and embedded systems.</p>
